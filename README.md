Why You Need This Plugin ❗

Razorpay Magic Checkout often skips WooCommerce email hooks, causing:

❌ No order confirmation emails for customers

❌ No new order emails for admins

❌ No visibility into why emails fail

WooCommerce Email Booster solves this by forcing email triggers and providing a logging system for complete transparency.
